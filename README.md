# ü™ê Planet Orbit Simulator

A captivating 2D simulation of planets orbiting a central star, built with Pygame. This project visualizes gravitational forces and orbital mechanics in a simple yet engaging way.

## ‚ú® Features
Realistic Orbital Mechanics: Planets attract each other based on Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

Scalable Simulation: Adjust SCALE and TIMESTEP to explore different orbital behaviors.

Interactive Visualization: Watch planets trace their paths in real-time.

Distance Tracking: Displays the distance of each planet from the sun (in kilometers).

Customizable Planets: Easily add or modify planets with different masses, radii, and colors.

## üöÄ How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Millsjr/Planet-Orbit-Simulator.git
cd Planet-Orbit-Simulator

(Note: Replace https://github.com/Millsjr/Planet-Orbit-Simulator.git with your actual repository URL if different, and Planet-Orbit-Simulator with your repository name.)

Install dependencies:
This project requires pygame. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

pip install pygame

Run the simulation:

python your_script_name.py

(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., main.py if you save the code as main.py)

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
Python

Pygame - A set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## üí° Future Enhancements
Add more planets (Jupiter, Saturn, etc.).

Implement user controls for zooming or changing simulation speed.

Display additional orbital parameters (e.g., orbital period).

Add collision detection between planets.

Implement a pause/play feature.
